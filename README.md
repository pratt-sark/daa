Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Codes assigned to me in the course 'Design and Analysis of Algorithms' are stored here. 

Some codes are common, while some like Binary Search Tree having alphanumeric data or 
Level-Order-filling Binary tree are ones I couldn't find on the Internet, so I coded 
them with the help of some of my friends.

Feel free to use these. If this helps someone, I'm happy :)
Thanks!
